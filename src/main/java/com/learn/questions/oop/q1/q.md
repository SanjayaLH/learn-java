Q1
## Scenario
You are designing a payment system that supports multiple payment methods, such as Credit Card, PayPal, and Bank Transfer. Each payment method requires unique validation logic before processing a payment.
#### Task:
Design an interface PaymentProcessor and implement concrete classes for each payment method. Demonstrate how polymorphism can be used to process payments dynamically based on the payment method selected by a user.
