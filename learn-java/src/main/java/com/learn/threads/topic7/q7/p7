7. Passing Messages
----------------------
Problem:
Create a logging system where multiple threads can log messages to a shared log file asynchronously.
Use message passing to ensure that log entries are not corrupted.
    - log message producer -> write messages to queue.
        - has multiple
    - log message consumer -> read log message from queue and print it to the shared log file.
        - has multiple - after discussion with Kalpa this is wrong
    - had to add timestamp to identify the time


without synchronized block for queue in the produceMsg() and the writeMsg() the order was not guaranteed.
