3. Synchronization
---------------------------
Create a banking application where multiple users can deposit and withdraw money
concurrently from a shared account without data corruption.

- Check the output without join() first.
- Added AccountException class to throw Runtime exception

    - No Data Corruption- synchronized ensures one thread modifies balance at a time.
    - Enhancement -> Replace synchronized with ReentrantLock for more control.
                     Can use ExecutorService for better thread management.
