16. Uncaught Exceptions
------------------------
Problem:
Create a system that processes incoming data feeds where each feed is handled by a separate thread.
Implement an uncaught exception handler to log errors and restart the thread if it fails unexpectedly.

Incoming data feed processor
1. Have to simulate a data feed---> can add it to main method because only need to simulate
2. Store the data feed--> BlockingQueue
3. Process data feed by separate thread(multiple threads)
4. Have to have uncaught exception handler
5. have to simulate thread failer and log error
6. restart the failed thread ----> have to double check this function
