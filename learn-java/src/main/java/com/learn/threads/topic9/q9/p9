9. Scheduling and Priority
---------------------------
Thread priorities:
1. mainly 3 priorities
2.    /**
       * The minimum priority that a thread can have.
       */
      public static final int MIN_PRIORITY = 1;

      /**
       * The default priority that is assigned to a thread.
       */
      public static final int NORM_PRIORITY = 5;

      /**
       * The maximum priority that a thread can have.
       */
      public static final int MAX_PRIORITY = 10;

Problem:
Design a simulation where multiple background tasks and a critical task are running concurrently.
Use thread priorities to ensure that the critical task receives more CPU time compared to background tasks.
    - do we want to use join() for this? what happened if use it?
    - need to know about latency numbers(by Jeff Dean)
