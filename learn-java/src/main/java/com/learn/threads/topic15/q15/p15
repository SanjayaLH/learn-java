15. Working with ThreadGroups
-----------------------------
Problem:
Develop an application that simulates a multi-tier service architecture with different service levels,
each represented by a ThreadGroup.
Implement features to dynamically adjust the number of threads per service level based on workload.

web application with 3 tire architecture
- Presentation layer
- Business logic layer
- Data access layer

    - each layer has thread group
    1. Create separate ThreadGroups for each tier.(can use Enum to crate a thread group.
     Is it give any value?)
    2. Start with a fixed number of threads per group.
    3. Simulate tasks being submitted (like user http requests in ppt layer).
    4. Have to change workload per group
        - adjustThreads() created to do it
    5. Have to measure workload per group
    6. Add more threads if workload is high.
     Reduce threads (or let them finish) when workload drops.
    7. Include a shared task queue per group.
    8. Gracefully shutdown
        - shutdown()

    Special Notes:
    - Can remove startWork() by adding createWorker() method inside the constructor,
    then it will create a thread each time it call
