14. Thread Groups
------------------
Problem:
Implement a server handling multiple client connections where each client connection
is managed by a separate thread. Group threads by functionality and implement features to count active
threads and to stop all threads simultaneously on shutdown.

- have to have 2 thread groups
    1. client connection threads --- no need to create TG ----> create thread T
    2. handler threads

    - need to count active threads -
        - how? ------------> can get ThreadGroup class
        - countActiveThreads()

    - simultaneously stop all threads
        - how?
        - shutdown()
