17. Thread Performance
-----------------------
Problem:
Implement an application that performs image processing tasks in parallel using threads.
Measure and optimize the thread execution time to enhance performance.

- function -> processImage()
- need to divide an image to subimages
    - calTaskAmount(int numOfRows, int numOfCols) --> calculate # image chunks
- subimages should added to a queue
    -createTask(String imageName, int imageChunks) create sub images and added to the queue
- should be able to increase and decrease threads and check the performance of application
- Struggling to measuring the time
    - threads added to a array and added when creating the threads
    - start time b4 start threads

- Changes related to code review:
    - Change the functionality of uploadImage() and signature.
    - added processImage() and remove unwanted methods
    - added 2d array as DS
